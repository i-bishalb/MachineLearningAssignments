# MachineLearning Assignments <br>

[Machine Learning Assignments (Small projects)](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments)
    These are some of the projects that were carried out while taking courses with machine learning. <br>
1. **Regression**
    1. [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Predicting_Housing_Prices_Regression/Predicting_Housing_Prices_Regression.ipynb): <br>
     In this project, I have predicted housing prices using the boston housing data. I have used **Linear Regression** and regularized regression methods: **Lasso Regression**, **Ridge Regression** and **ElasticNet Regression** to predict the housing prices. Polynomial of degree 2 does a good job in predicting housing prices. Best models for each method were selected using extensive gridsearch. All 3 regularized models (**Lasso Regression**, **Ridge Regression** and **ElasticNet Regression**) show similar accuracy for prediction. <br>
    2. [California Housing Prices](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Housing_Prices_Regression/California_Housing_Regression.ipynb): <br> 
      In this project, I have carried out regression calculations to predict housing prices using the california housing data. I have used Linear models:
      **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression** and Non-linear models **Random Forest Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbor Regression** and **Support Vector Machine Regression (with gaussian kernel (rbf))**. The model highlights the complexity in some dataset and the need to use non-linear or beyond linear models to get an accurate prediction.<br>
2. **Classification**
   1. [Churn prediction](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Bank_Customers_Churn_Classification/Churn_Classification.ipynb): <br>
           In this project, I have carried out binary classification prediction to predict customers churning or not-churing. I have used 7 classifiers for the problem namely: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, **Decision Tree Classifier**, **K Neighbors Classifier**, **Support Vector Machine Classifier** and Boosting methods **Ada Boost Classifier** and **Gradient Boosting Classifier**. The two boosting methods and Random Forest Classifier have the best predictions. A majority **Voting classifier** shows same accuracy as the best three classifiers. 
   2. [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Loan_Default_Prediction/Single_family_loan_prediction.ipynb): <br>
           In this project, I have carried out classification prediction to predict whether a loan will default or not. I have used 4 classifires for the problem: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, **K Neighbors Classifier** and **Gradient Boosting Classifier**. The simplest classifier (Logistic Regression) does the best job of predicting loan default.
        
 3. **Deep Learning and Neural Networks**
       1. [Fashion Classification](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Zalando_Fashion_Classification/Zalando_Clothing_Classification.ipynb):
         In this project, I have carried out image classfication from Zalando image dataset. I have utilized **Convolution Neural Network (CNN)** to train the model. I have build a simple model first and a complex model. The complex model make a better prediction (88 % versus 91 %). I have further utilized **Keras-Tuner** to tune hyperparameters for the **CNN** model.
       2. [Predicting Stock Prices](https://github.com/i-bishalb/MachineLearningAssignments/blob/main/Predicting_Stock_Prices/Stock_Prices_Prediction.ipynb):
         In this project, I have carried out **Time-series analysis** and build models using **ARIMA** and **LSTM**  to predict stock prices. The deep-learning based LSTM models does much better job in understanding the complex pattern and predicting the stock prices.
