In this project, we are going to predict housing prices for the boston housing data. I have used **Linear Regression** and regularized regression methods: **Lasso regression**, **Ridge regression** and **ElasticNet** to predict the housing prices. Polynomial of degree 2 does a good job in predicting housing prices. Best models for each method were selected using extensive gridsearch. All 3 regularized models (**Lasso regression**, **Ridge regression** and **ElasticNet**) show similar accuracy for prediction.
