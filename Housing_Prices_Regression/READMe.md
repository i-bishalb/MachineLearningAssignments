In this project, I have carried out regression calculations to predict housing prices using the california housing data. I have used Linear models:
      **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression** and Non-linear models **Random Forest Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbor Regression** and **Support Vector Machine Regression (with gaussian kernel (rbf))**. The model highlights the complexity in some dataset and the need to use non-linear or beyond linear models to get an accurate prediction.
