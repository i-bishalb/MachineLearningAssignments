In this project, I have carried out image classfication from Zalando image dataset. I have utilized **Convolution Neural Network (CNN)** to train the model. I have build a simple model first and a complex model. The complex model make a better prediction (88 % versus 91 %). I have further utilized **Keras-Tuner** to tune hyperparameters for the **CNN** model.
